I always like puzzles and figuring out how to solve them. Code to me is one big puzzle. I have also always been a computer guy. I worked for 7 years doing IT work in my local city of south Bend. I really liked solving the puzzles people presented to me when there computer wasnâ€™t working right. So the need to jump into the puzzle further was always a dream and curiosity i needed to satisfy.

A software engineer gets to solve to solve these puzzles.
